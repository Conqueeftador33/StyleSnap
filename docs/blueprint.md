## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dusty rose (#C2A3A3), evoking a sense of soft sophistication and connection to fashion.
- Background color: Very light grayish rose (#F0ECEC). A subtle desaturation of the primary hue offers a visually soothing backdrop, appropriate for a light scheme.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#A3A3C2), positioned next to the primary hue of dusty rose. It will create gentle contrast without disrupting the overall aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a serif typeface that offers high personality and aligns to a fashion-forward art and design aesthetic. Body text font: 'Alegreya' a serif offering elegance and intellectual flair.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent clothing categories and filter options.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the virtual wardrobe to showcase clothing items in a visually appealing and organized manner.
- Incorporate smooth transitions when navigating between the virtual wardrobe and individual clothing items.
